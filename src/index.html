            <p>Simple chess engine written in TypeScript. For now, 
                there is a rudimentary AI that makes decisions mostly randomly.  
                If it has an opportunity to capture a piece, it will, no matter what.
                If it can capture multiple pieces, it will gnab the one with the highest 
                points value.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Both sides are human-controlled by default.</li>
                <li>To activate the AI, click on the team you want it to control.</li>
                <li>Click that team again to disengage it.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This is simply my way of figuring out chess for TypeScript, it's 
                not intended to be redistributable.  If you want a library that is 
                redistributable to build your own chess game, use the official 
                <a href="https://chessboardjs.com/" target="_blank">Chessboard.js</a>.  
                If you want to see what this thing can do because you're curious, 
                poke away.</p>
